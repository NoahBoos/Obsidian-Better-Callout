# Obsidian - Better Callouts
## Giving you the tools you need to make simple, efficient and aesthetic Obsidian Callouts.
### What is Better Callouts for Obsidian ?
Better Callouts is a package of CSS Snippets for Obsidian that enhances your note-taking experience by providing pre-built callouts and allowing you to create your own custom callouts.
### What does it concretely bring to you ?
If you are a dedicated user of Obsidian Callout, you may have noticed that native callouts provided by Obsidian can be quite restrictive in terms of customization.
Better Callouts solves this issue and offers you the ability to structure your notes more effectively by providing new pre-built callouts along with innovative ways to customize them.
### How does it work ?
This package includes various CSS snippets that consist of pre-built callouts declaration and callouts metadata.
Callout metadata is used to apply styles to the callout it is used on. With this feature, Better Callouts allows you to add or remove elements from a callout.

> [!TIP]
> To use callout metadata, simply add `|myMetadata1 myMetadata2` after the callout declaration. 
> *For example :*
> ```md
> > [!CALLOUT|myMetadata1 myMetadata2]
> ```
> Keep in mind that in this example `myMetadata1` and `myMetadata2` are placeholder used to illustrate how callout metadata work, they do not represent actual metadata in Better Callouts.

## How to install & use Better Callout ?
To successfully install and use Better Callout, please follow these steps.
- Download the latest `.zip` release of the project.
- Unpack the `.zip` and place the `.css` files in your `snippets` folder, located in the `.obsidian` folder of your vault.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `snippets` folder doesn't exist in your vault's `.obsidian` folder, just create it. :>

- Open Obsidian and go to `Options > Appearance`.
- Scroll down this "Appearance" settings page until you see a section called "CSS Snippets".
- Activate all the files you downloaded.

> [!TIP]
> If you already have some CSS Snippets disabled and you don't know what CSS Snippets you have just installed, enable the one with the name starting with "MBR"[^1].
